# Introduction to Jupyter notebooks

Today's session will be brutal in terms of information I am going to throw at you but potentially very rewarding with respect to concepts, tools and useful resources you can get out of it.
As a scientist you are expected to be independent find out the things you need on your own. We expect that as well. Most of the work you will have to do on your own. You will have to experiment! With the tools and with your workflows that come out of it. But we will give you a head start by exposing you to the most important concepts and tools, how they best fit together and which resources are best to get going with them.

## Overview Jupyter notebooks
- reconcile code and documentation using the browser
  - like a labbook for code and plots
  - easy to view and hand over
- can be used with different scripting languages
  - Python
  - R
  - (Matlab)
- has tools built around it
  - can be used for presentations
  - can be shared and read online using nbviewer
  - can be shared, run and modified online using binder

# Package managers and virtual environments

A package manager
- keeps track of installed software packages
- provides a list of available software packages
- enables a user to install available software packages from available off-site repositories
- different ones exist for OS system packages or programming language libraries

A virtual environment
- is a tool that keeps software packages separate from the operating system.
- can be used to install different versions of the same software.
- can be used to document and re-create and share an analysis environment.

(Ana)Conda is a cross platform package manager and a virtual environment.

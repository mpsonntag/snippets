# Introduction to jupyter notebooks

Today's session will be brutal in terms of information I am going to throw at you but potentially very rewarding with respect to concepts, tools and useful resources you can get out of it.
As a scientist you are expected to be independent find out the things you need on your own. We expect that as well. Most of the work you will have to do on your own. You will have to experiment! With the tools and with your workflows that come out of it. But we will give you a head start by exposing you to the most important concepts and tools, how they best fit together and which resources are best to get going with them.

## Why jupyter notebooks

- reconcile code and documentation
- easy to hand over
- can be used for presentations
- can be used with different scripting and programming languages

show of hands

who knows how to script with matlab
who knows how to script with python
who knows how to script with R

who knows virtual environments or conda
who knows ipython or jupyter notebooks
who knows markdown

## Introduction to Python

Not by me

Here are three links to lessons tailored for scientists; can each be done in 1/2 - 1 day:
- https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation
- https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder
- https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson

They include
- Python essentials; fundamentals, functions, exceptions, debugging
- Data handling libraries
- Data loading, handling and plotting

## Markdown

Get reference sheet

- how to put images in

## Jupyter shortcuts

Get reference sheet

## Internals

look at json

pitfall: jupyter and git

## Installation variants

pip (native, not recommended)
virtual environment (will probably fade out)
conda (with respect to OS adaption probably the best option)
binder

## Python Libraries

The most important ones

ipython
jupyter
numpy
matplotlib
pandas

work with pip

work with conda

widgets; interactive jupyter notebooks

## Jupyter example

Save with vs without results

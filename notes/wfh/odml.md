## container sections
- Add a clone_empty multiple times to a section; will be added to the parent section, name and type will stay the same, only the counter in name will go up. all properties will also be cloned but with empty values, units etc?
 - define
- add a clone child section to section, hand over a specific child section e.g. by name or id and clone it empty multiple times
- write a container section description in the tutorial; how to handle 

## validations
- if we had dedicated container sections, we could check all direct child sections for consistency of name, type, properties, etc.

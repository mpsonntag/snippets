# RDM Strategy of NFDI Neuroscience

- Neuroscience data are diverse and complex
- sharing of data is hard due to this diversity
- new concepts of data management need to be developed and introduced to make data sharable and usable in the future.

## NFDI Neuroscience - Concept and approach
- coordinate interaction of expert neuroscientists to address RDM needs and function as nodes for solution development.

## RDM Strategy
- there already are many neuroscience resources out there
- what needs to be done is to make them aware of each other and make them interoperable
- also an infrastructure is needed to create common workflows with and for these tools.
- participation of labs is required!

## How to participate
- NFDI should be a platform to collect tools from labs and make them available and support in further development.

## Comments
- Phillip Tovote
  - thanks for work so far and the community approach
  - sections (task areas) are a good idea
  - next to idealism in how to make science better and top down approach of funding, how can the community motivate itself for the task at hand. but the system is driven by impact factor and there is no reward for proper data management and sharing might be even contra productive.
  - this is a complex, philosphical discussion but should be had
  - there should be an incentive implemented into the initiative that gives an outlook in how proper data management can help with the career
- Thomas Wachtler:
    - the scientist is more effective with proper RDM. With starting a community it would be easier to overcome the immediate reward barrier.
    - with respect to open data there is no established credit system for open data yet, but journals already support data publications and credits for data publication will come in time.
- Otto Witte
    - many data repos are too much work! too much documentation!
    - more positive impulses for data publications are required
    - funded research must demand open data publication
- Lucia Melloni
    - use this initiative to develop guidelines
    - this can work as an incentive for a community
    - working in a large collaboration and data management is a nightmare; because the sharing is hard and the rewards for limited positions like PhDs they need to profit in some way
    - the rewards need to be actively developed
- Sonja Gruen:
    - first round of student will have a hard time
    - second round of students can work on the collected data already
    - we need to overcome this initial collection step
- Michael Hanke
    - there is a point in additional incentives
    - but the initiative should remove the need for incentives and make the RDM so easy to make training less costly
  - Karl Kafitz
    - students actually like RDM if they get the chance
    - a problem are the universities since they do not give much support with respect to RDM in individual labs - there money is a problem, as soon as money is involved, the universities get hesitant.
- Michael Denker
    - students are extremely motivated
    - are lacking the experience in RDM topics themselves since they come from different background
    - funding and acknowledging RDM efforts are important
- Julien Colomb
    - the DFG should be actively engaged in requiring incentives for grants with respect to RDM

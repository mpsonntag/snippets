[T] conference note
... would it not be nice to have stamps and postcards with every conference

[T] conference
Print posters 2x on A4 and cut in the middle for BCCN as handouts

[T] GIN
We should probably have a usermap - where users are from on the dashboard

[T] DataLad
What is the status of DataLad and GIN? Do they crawl GIN already?

[C] Elixir-europe.org - life science common data space
Check which workflow tools they support for gin-proc

[C] bioschemas.org
for odML? get a template for a bioschema dataset

[C] NiPype

[!] Harvester is a nice term

[C] SHACL validations

[C] researchobjects.org

[T] Add JSON, YAML and XML validators to gin-valid because why not

[T] Get the cording of carole Goble from the INCF conference - FAIRy stories
    good to present to people to explain what fair is and what it is not.

[T] Put GSoC Badge on BCCN gin-proc?

[C] Binder for jupyter notebooks ... [T] get badge for NIX and odML?

[T] Should we advertise the IRC and public slack channel for everyone
    e.g. on conference so people have another channel to contact us?

[C] djneuro.io
    The datajoint query language as template for fuzzy queries in odML RDF.
    Might be very interesting to deal with querying complex data 
    Not sure if the licensing permits though

[C] neurohackademy -> github

[T] RDF poster is missing link to odml-query

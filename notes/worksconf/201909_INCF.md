[T] conference note
... would it not be nice to have stamps and postcards with every conference

[T] conference
Print posters 2x on A4 and cut in the middle for BCCN as handouts

[T] GIN
We should probably have a usermap - where users are from on the dashboard

[T] DataLad
What is the status of DataLad and GIN? Do they crawl GIN already?

[C] Elixir-europe.org - life science common data space
Check which workflow tools they support for gin-proc

[C] bioschemas.org
for odML? get a template for a bioschema dataset

[C] NiPype

[!] Harvester is a nice term

[C] SHACL validations

[C] researchobjects.org

[T] Add JSON, YAML and XML validators to gin-valid because why not

[T] Get the cording of carole Goble from the INCF conference - FAIRy stories
    good to present to people to explain what fair is and what it is not.

[T] Put GSoC Badge on BCCN gin-proc?

[C] Binder for jupyter notebooks ... [T] get badge for NIX and odML?

    https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io

    Binder ... providing a link to an online running, interactive notebook
    from within a github repository
    https://mybinder.org/

    Could add this to the nix-demo repo
    [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/G-Node/nix-demo/master)


[T] Should we advertise the IRC and public slack channel for everyone
    e.g. on conference so people have another channel to contact us?

[C] djneuro.io
    The datajoint query language as template for fuzzy queries in odML RDF.
    Might be very interesting to deal with querying complex data 
    Not sure if the licensing permits though

[C] neurohackademy -> github

    https://github.com/neurohackademy

[T] RDF poster is missing link to odml-query 



### 02.09

[C] supFUNSlim -> github
    matlab toolbox but with jupyter notebooks?

[T] Checkout bitbucket and gitlab ... add some of the github repos there
    to see how both platforms work, which features they have and if they 
    can be used together with github.

[C] ASAPbio.org ... preprint service
  - check the preprint service e.g. BioRxiv, Arxiv

[T] should we get pre-prints of GIN and NIX? would be citable and available 
    even if we take longer for a proper paper

[T] can we put odML / NIX / gin on google scholar? Is NWB there?
[C]

[T] Add RRID to odML templates

[C] if we have ownership of the RRID project pages for NIX and odML

[T] Make a list of all these open source and access tools and sites and do a presentation 
    for students.

    CONP -> canadian open neuroscience platform
    Samir D...? sounds very similar, maybe they can reuise some of our stuff? e.g client
    neurolibre.conp.ca

[C] ebrains.eu -> launched in october

[T] poster: add a go/py badge on the relevant projects -> some people will know the 
    language its written in at a glance and add the docker icon where it applies.

[T] odML: is there an issue about ID when importing from a template / terminology
    should receive a new ID for template - but should it receive one for terminology?
    because that one should be unique while template needs to be unique for each 
    application of a template with individual values.

[T] odML: check import of temp/term from odml.g-node.org - add it as default to
    the libraries if it works w/o problem.

[C] cell type ontology for odml templates from allenbraininstitute?

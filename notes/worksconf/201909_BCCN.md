    ... thinking about what is the difference 
        of our services and e.g.

    - exdir

[C] - open science foundation

    - DataJoint - Creating and sharing data processing pipelines
        basically an abstraction layer for database setup and use
        connected to defining data processing pipelines and writing
        back to the created/supported database.
        with this the database setup as well as any connected
        data analysis pipelines and results queries can easily 
        be shared.

## Pre-Workshop notes:

why is consistent recording, structuring of data necessary:

in your context there are a couple of cases to consider:
a) personal stake: when you write the protocol for this course not tomorrow, but in one or two weeks from now
   (I've heard it happen, that protocols arrive half a year later...)
   you need to remember the details of the experiment to make sense of the resulting
   data.
   this means saving the raw data + stimulus data + analysis data + metadata (information 
   how the experiment was conducted and which equipment and ingredients were used)
b) the protocol - and subsequently the underlying data - needs to be understandable
   by the ones trying to make sense out of your results. in your case your tutors, 
   in the larger sense it will be your PIs or your reviewers -> how can they
   review the data, if they do not have access to proprietory software.

c) comparative analysis - when trying to figure out if a procedure works well
   multiple same experiments from various experimenters need to be compared
   e.g. to see if antibodies for the same question perform differently - 
   in your case your data and metadata should be uniformly saved so that comparisons
   across all your results can be possible, ideally in an automated fashion.


### Immunohistochemistry

- date, experiment title and brief desc, experimenter
- organic material (mouse)
- Antibodies; primary and secondary (chicken, rabbit, mouse, goat)
- Staining Protocols
- Microscope setups
- Results

### MEA retina recordings

is this experiment actually performed within the scope of the practical course? [???]

- date, experiment title and brief desc, experimenter
- organic material -> which piece of the eye?
- MEA
- LED
- Whole setup (cfg "Chicken retina skript: Overall layout of the setup")
- Stimulus protocols (software MCStim)
- buffer solutions
- software used
  - Operating system; version; build/update state
  - MCStim; version
  - MCRack recorder; version

- Raw data are MEA voltage traces stored on disk
- Analysis is done online during the course of two days using specific software
  -> what are the raw and analysed data output formats [???]


Information from the scriptum:

Hi everyone

Michael Sonntag
If you have any questions, feel free to ask them here in the chat, my colleague Achilleas Koutsou and me, Michael Sonntag, will be happy to pop in and answer any questions you might have.


## conference handling notes

- people expect the same login on all pages; they are confused by too many logins
-> keep that in mind for next years setup -> either avoid a different login alltogether for
   the poster gallery or a) have the registration page as the home page or have the login page
   display the registration notice as the most prominent information.

Hi everyone!

We are presenting our GIN datahosting services and the data formats NIX and odML.

Please leave any question you have in the chat or even better join in and ask us directly! Going interactive makes it easier for us to figure out in which of our tools you are interested the most!

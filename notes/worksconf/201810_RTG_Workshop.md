- ToDo: NIX - verify method. to make extra sure that a dataset has been properly 
  imported, add a verify method that automatically compares value by value raw data 
  with data within a nix dataset.


DOI notes: 

issue:
- put a big disclaimer on the doi request site that if someone renames the repo stupid 
  stuff will happen so think about repo naming FIRST.
- internally refactor the process of DOI so we can point a DOI to a renamed repo again 
  (let them have a DOI that is already there for the originally named repo).

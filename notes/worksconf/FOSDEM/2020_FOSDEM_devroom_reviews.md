The Open Research Technologies devroom aims to:
    Allow knowledge-based tool developers to publicize their effort and become aware of other FLOSS projects.
    Facilitate the pooling of coding efforts on (often poorly funded) tools.
    Create a network where otherwise isolated developers, research engineers can share common FLOSS concerns.
    Provide social recognition for people who work in fields where designing and developing tools is less considered than usual outcomes (e.g. not publishing papers in research, not writing investigation in data journalism, etc).

We seek talks about:
    New software releases of research tools or technologies.
    Feedback on open technology stacks used in research contexts (e.g., scientific research, journalistic inquiry, archive creation or publication, etc.) which collect, analyse, document, visualize, and/or share data.
    Tool design and implementation for specific research contexts, e.g. how to hold an algorithm accountable to social scientists, how to foster better replicability and interoperability thanks to FLOSS, how to cope with biases of a chart for a data journalist, etc.
    Issues and opportunities about bridging tech culture with research environments (research labs, libraries, newsrooms, museums, etc.).

Submissions must include:
    Abstract
    Session type (Lecture or Lightning Talk)
    Session length (20-40 min, 10 min for a lightning talk)
    Expected prior knowledge / intended audience
    Speaker bio
    Links to code / slides / material for the talk (optional)
    Links to previous talks by the speaker

    trying to bridge the gap between development and research sound very
    interesting and fitting to the room.

- is it in scope? : yes open access platform
- speaker bio: no
- links to previous talks: yes

- general notes:
  - we don't know them
  - ask for bio?
  - can't put my finger on it, but I am not sure about this abstract it somehow
    does not seem to really fit the context of the devroom. on the plus side it 
    does sound interesting from the collaborative aspect.

- Is the submission complete : yes
- Is it open source ? : yes

Title
High dimensional sampling and volume computation applications in engineering and science
--------
Notes MS
- keywords to organize talk order: scientific software

- Is the submission complete : yes
- Is it open source ? : yes
- is it in scope? : yes
- speaker bio: yes
- links to previous talks: yes

- general notes:
  - we don't know them
  - I think this talk is very specialized but fits the scope; it is presenting
    an implemented open source sampling method. Since it is not about collaboration,
    asking for feedback, engaging in discussion we might want to aks if it can
    be shortened to a lightning talk - if the speaker wants to stay with this condition
    in our track I think they should be welcome.

Title
Mermaid Tataki with PANDORÃ†
--------
Notes MS
- keywords to organize talk order: political science, open data

- Is the submission complete : yes
- Is it open source ? : yes
- is it in scope? : 
- speaker bio: yes
- links to previous talks: yes

- general notes:
  - the abstract was extremely general, while the tool behind it sounds quite 
    specialized; after reading it twice I was not sure what exactly this tool
    is about. Should we ask for a more technical abstract?
  - lightning talk candidate?

Title
NeuroFedora: Enabling Free/Open Neuroscience
--------
Notes MS
- keywords to organize talk order: scientific software, open science

- Is the submission complete : partially
- Is it open source ? : yes
- is it in scope? : yes
- speaker bio: no
- links to previous talks: no

- general notes:
  - we are aware of the project and know some people working with it
  - ask for speaker bio and previous talks
  - since it is an umbrella talk about an operating system with a focus
    on science, we might ask them to include a section how people could 
    contribute e.g. where and how to upload packages to this distribution
    or where help is appreciated?

    scientific field, but the talk will feel out of place amongst
    the other talks. maybe we should try to find another room for
    them that is a better fit?

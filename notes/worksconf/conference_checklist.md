Conference check sheet, preparations and todos
- G-Node:
  The Bernstein facility for Data Management Technology!
- with respect to the poster:
  - it was very good to have at least a simplified version of the data model
  people that wanted to know more where actually interested to see a bit
  of the internals.
- Tabrotate:
  - Use revolver tab plugin in chromium
  - As heading across the address bar:
  - Modern Research Data Management for Neuroscience

  we usually don't have a table on Saturday...
- [gnode conference booth setup] What we still need for the booth
  - G-Node table banner ... we can ask BCOS to provide us with banner and prop ups
  - A4 prop-up
  - table beamer instead of screen
  - get a g-node banner for hiding the feet at conferences
  - do a Prezi presentation for future conferences! prezi.com
  - get cardboard boxes as prop-ups

- Conference presentation preparations:
  - DataJoint - people were asking how our stuff compares and what would be
    our selling features in comparison.
    DataJoint:
    - Data pipeline and hosting solution to share common data pipelines
    - Python and Matlab
    - Backend uses relational DB, sets up tables for a project 
      (the user has to set up their own table structure)
    - Provides user with a specific data definition language and provides a query language 
      and visualization (of the pipeline).
    - Data stored in Janelia (USofA)
    Comparison:
    - in both the user has to set up their own schema / use case.
    - in datajoint it is unclear how large sets of raw data will behave.
    - datajoint is the right use case if you want a wrapper around pytables 
      and some convenience functions.
    - it is unclear how and where actual data is stored.

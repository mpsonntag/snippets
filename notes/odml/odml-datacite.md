To manually get the datacite file for a CRCNS.org publication
- get the title from the CRCNS data-set details page
- paste with quotes in search.datacite.org
- open result page and DL XML or JSON datacite file from link on the side

- replace link to https://search.datacite.org/works/10.6080/k0wd3xh6

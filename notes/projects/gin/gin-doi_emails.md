## Missing license

Dear [xyz],

We have received your request to register a new dataset from the GIN repository at https://gin.g-node.org/[xyz]. Before we can proceed with the publication, there is one issue that should be addressed:

1. There is no LICENSE file in the repository. While the datacite.yml specifies the license, we also require that the full text of the license is also included in the repository, which in turn is distributed with the dataset archive for any user that might obtain it.

Once this issue is resolved, please resubmit the request and we will proceed with the publication.

Thank you and best regards,

[xyz]
G-Node

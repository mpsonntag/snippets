# in-house-GIN slack workspace

The in-house GIN has gained a lot of traction in the last year, which we are very 
happy to see and also happy to support as much as we can. With the growing number of
in-house GIN users, we also receive many requests for service set-up support and 
maintenance. Often these are simple matters, and we try to keep the documentation as
up-to date and helpful as possible, but since we are a small open-source team, the 
growing demand for support takes up quite some of our time.

Since we are providing this service for free, we would like to ask you in to support 
your fellow in-house users and help each other out running the service.
To this end we are running a dedicated slack workspace at in-house-gin.slack.com. 
Slack can be used either via the browser or by a dedicated slack app.

To join this workspace, we would ask you to send an email to gin@g-node.org with the 
email address you would like to be invited with. Please note, that this email address 
will be available to all other members in the channel, use an email address you are 
comfortable sharing.

This is also the place to discuss new features or companion services that you are employing 
or would like to try in tandem with GIN. The G-Node team is also hanging around the 
channel to discuss and help out as much as we can.

You can also fork the in-house repository and supply pull requests to update
the in-house documentation with information you would like to see included, open issues
on the in-house issue tracker or post them in the slack channels.

We are happy to provide this service for free and are also happy to provide support,
but in return, please help share our workload, help out your fellow in-house users and 
improve the whole project in the long run.

Thank you and stay in touch,
the G-Node team

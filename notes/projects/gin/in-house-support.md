# in-house-GIN slack workspace

The in-house GIN has gained a lot of traction in the last year, which we are very 
happy to see and also happy to support as much as we can. With the growing number of
in-house GIN users, we also receive many requests for service set-up support and 
maintenance. Often these are simple matters, and we try to keep the documentation as
up-to date and helpful as possible, but since we are a small open-source team, the 
growing demand for support takes up quite some of our time.

Since we are providing this service for free, we would like to ask you in turn to support 
your fellow in-house users and in return get help, support and new ideas from them.
We are running a dedicated slack workspace at in-house-gin.slack.com. Slack can be used
either simply via the browser or by a dedicated slack app.

To join this workspace, we would ask you to send an email to gin@g-node.org with the 
email address you would like to be invited with. Please note, that this email address 
will be available to all other members in the channel so use an email address you are 
comfortable sharing.

The channel is meant as a means to talk to other in-house users, ask for support regarding 
issues you are facing and help each other out running the service.

This is also the place to discuss new features or companion services that you are employing 
or would like to try in tandem with GIN. The G-Node team is also hanging around the 
channel to discuss and help out as much as we can.

You can also always fork the in-house repository and supply pull requests to update
the in-house documentation with information you would like to be included, open issues
on the in-house issue tracker or simply post them in the slack channels.

If you have suggestions to improve the support and enhance the in-house GIN 
community, please feel free to let us know in the slack channels or via email to
gin@g-node.org.

We are happy to provide this service for free and are also happy to provide support,
but in return, please help share our workload, help out your fellow in-house users and 
improve the whole project in the long run.

Thank you and stay in touch,
the G-Node team

gin in-house slack channel

The in-house GIN has gained a lot of traction in the last year which we are very 
happy to see and also happy to support as much as we can. With the growing number of
in-house gin users, we also receive many requests for help with setting up and running
the service. Often these are simple matters and we try to keep the documentation as
up-to date and helpful as possible, but since we are a small open-source team, the 
growing demand for support takes up quite some of our time.

Since we are providing this service for free, we would like to ask you in turn to support 
your fellow in-house users and in return get help, support and new ideas from them.
We are running a dedicated slack channel at in-house-gin.slack.com; to join, please send 
an email to gin@g-node.org with the email address that you would like to be invited with.
Please note, that this email address will be available to all other members in the
channel so use an email address you are comfortable sharing.

The channel is meant as a means to talk to other in-house users, ask for support regarding 
issues you are facing and help each other out running the service.

This is also the place to discuss new features or tips and tricks that you are imploying 
or would like to try in tandem with gin.
The G-Node team is also hanging around the channel to discuss and help out.

You can also always fork the in-house repository and supply pull requests to update
the in-house documentation with information you would like to be included or just
put it in issues or post it in the slack channels.

If you have suggestions what else we can do to support and enhance the in-house gin 
community, please feel free to let us know, again in the slack channel or via email to
gin@g-node.org.

Again, we are happy to provide this service for free and are also happy to help
out with arising issues, but in return, please help share our workload, help
out your fellow in-house users and improve the whole project in the long run.

Your G-Node team

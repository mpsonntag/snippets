# odml and NIX file collection

These files where collected from public repositories published on GIN.

The table below collects the original names and full paths of the collected files, the updated file name and whether the file was part of a DOI or not.

All files are collected in this folder, therefore the individual collected files have to renamed using the following scheme to ensure the files can be unambiguously saved and their original repository identified:

[GIN-User]__[Repository-Name]_[Original_filename]_###.[original_file_extension]

GIN-User and Repository-Name combined should not exceed 30 characters which should be sufficient to identify the original repository from the file name.

E.g. the odml file at repository https://gin.g-node.org/doi/efish_locking/src/master/2014-05-21-ab/metadata.xml would be renamed to doi__efish_locking_metadata_001.xml.

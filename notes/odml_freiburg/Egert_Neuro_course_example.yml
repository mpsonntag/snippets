  - name: experiment/stainingAntibodies [xxx] would it make sense to introduce a running experiment ID at this point for identification? e.g. A###_custom_name
    type: immunohistochemistry
    sections:
    - name: subject/A[xxx] use animalNumber? ... this section would make sense to move to its own file and reference here, since it is used in more than one experiment; could also be just a sheet that has to be filled in for starters

    - name: subject/B [xxx] use animalNumber? also not sure, if using this strain should not be a different experiment since a different AB combination is used compard to WT

Java/Scala web framework developer

We are looking for a software developer that wants to help us bring our Scala Web project to the next century.

The G-Node conference application (GCA)1 is a web service for creating and managing scientific conferences and submitting, reviewing and publishing conference abstracts. The project also features a progressive web application for offline access to published conferences and their content.
The project stack is comprised of Scala, Java, SBT as build tool, JavaScript (KnockoutJS), Play framework 2.3, authentication via Silhouette and Object relation mapping creating database tables from the backend classes. The development database is H2, the production database is Postgres. The project is deployed using Docker (compose). Backend tests are implemented using Scalatest, frontend tests are implemented using Selenium.

Work outline:
- Upgrade the web framework play 2.3 to the latest version 2.8 which requires a substantial rewrite of backend code to catch up to the latest framework version.

Java/Scala Backend/Frontend developer

Project description:

GCA is a web server for creating and managing scientific conferences and submitting, reviewing and publishing conference abstracts. The project also features a progressive web application for offline access to published conferences and their content.
The project stack is comprised of Scala, Java, SBT as build tool, JavaScript (KnockoutJS), Play framework 2.3, authentication via Silhouette and Object relation mapping creating database tables from the backend classes. The development database is H2, the production database is Postgres. The project is deployed using Docker (compose). Backend tests are implemented using Scalatest, frontend tests are implemented using Selenium.

Work outline:
- Upgrade the web framework play 2.3 to the latest version 2.8 which requires a substantial rewrite of backend code to catch up to the latest framework version.
- Update the current version of an existing progressive web application including thorough testing.
- Add new features to the main website as well as to the progressive web application.

Required knowledge: Java, Scala, JavaScript, Web-frameworks (ideally Play[link]), Docker deployment, git or a similar versioning tool.

Optional knowledge: Continuous integration (Travis), Frontend testing (Selenium), OR mapping, relational databases (H2, Postgres), Unit testing

# odml and NIX file collection

These files where collected from public repositories published on GIN.

The table states the original names and full paths of the collected files, the new name if a file had to be renamed, as well as whether the file was part of a DOI or not.

If there are no name conflicts all files are uploaded as is into a folder that is labelled as its origin repository. E.g. odml files from the repository https://gin.g-node.org/fabee/efish_locking are collected in a folder named fabee__efish_locking.

If there are name conflicts a repository contains multiple identically named files in different folders, the file names are adjusted by adding numbers to the file name. e.g. experiment.xml would be renamed to experiment_001.xml, experiment_002.xml etc. Renamed files are noted in the table.

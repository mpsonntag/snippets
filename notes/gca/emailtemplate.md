Dear !

The abstract submission service usually sends an eMail with 
an account activation link after a successful registration 
via the abstracts page. You are able to login after using the 
activation link in this eMail. We would like to ask you kindly 
to check your spam folder if this eMail has been redirected there.
If you have not received an eMail with an activation link, it
is possible that your institute rejected the eMail, which we 
are aware can happen on rare occasions.
In this case I would ask you to contact us again, so we can 
manually activate your account. Please don't hesitate to 
write us with this or any other questions you might have.

The conference organizers keep the abstract submission still
open until 
for a normal abstract submission.

Yours sincerely,
Michael Sonntag

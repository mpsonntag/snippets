Notes 20210123

- Very ephys centered ... crossover to imaging techniques, staining?
- p8 Fig3 ... the definitions for the predicates?

- p5 Fig1 ... what is the knowledge gain of the B) images? if there is none, please remove it

- p6 ... is the NPO onl for modeling as p6 exists? provide a definition of what this paper understands as modeling

- is this the full set of terms? if not how will it be expanded? e.g. does hasProteinExpression include stainings?

- p8 Fig3 ... is this the full model of molecular phenotypes

- Data and code availability is very hard to read

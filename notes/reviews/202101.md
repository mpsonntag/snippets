RDF NeuroPheno classifications

Notes 20210123

- Very ephys centered ... crossover to imaging techniques, staining?
- p8 Fig3 ... the definitions for the predicates?

- p5 Fig1 ... what is the knowledge gain of the B) images? if there is none, please remove it

- p6 ... is the NPO onl for modeling as p6 exists? provide a definition of what this paper understands as modeling

- is this the full set of terms? if not how will it be expanded? e.g. does hasProteinExpression include stainings?

- p8 Fig3 ... is this the full model of molecular phenotypes

- Data and code availability is very hard to read


Notes 20210124

- p12 ... not yet transparent how the minimal list of set of molex/morph is chosen to define a neuron

is the aim of NPO aimed only at mammalian neurons? if not include other data and examples as well to show the approach works there too and how.

what do they ant to show/achieve with this paper?
... search of terms and comparison across databases and identifying techniques provided competent personal feeds the database.

what are the results supposed to show? that the defined classes enable search? where is the gold standard showing it finds what is supposed to be found based on the used data?

this approach depends on proper curation of data to classes
... where is the description of this process if people are supposed to use it on their own?

p15 ... what is the point of the result? cool, a search result can be interpreted but how does this lead back to the introduced POV(?)? strange assumption unless I miss something.

ok ... so is this whole approach there to compare across phenotypes? is there no other approach that has tried this? if yes where and why is the new one better; if no, where is this statement?

Neuron Phenotype Ont ... describing complex phenotypes of Neurons

p20 F3 ... "include ID of data it describes" ... is that true with respect to the DATA

p19 ... is the definition of CUT and EBT the same as above??

is this reproducible? where is the description how this ontology was created from the basic sources.

this paper leaves me very confused after the first read...


Notes 20210129

- in general the curation of the basis of this data set is not well described enough from my point of view.
- the dataset is a secondary reference; how can the original data be accessed, verified and referenced? mistakes happen, which is ok, but there needs to be a mechanism to easily backcheck whats in the data set, how it got there and from where.

    The approach is great, but it is a secondary source; when various people of various backgrounds try to adopt it and add to it mistakes are bound to happen. Easy backchecking should be part of the definition in this case to verify any result of a search.

p4 "Anyone who has attempted to read through multiple articles, each with their
own proposal for classifying cell types within a region understands the difficulties in trying to
reconcile the different schemes, even when they are based on limited numbers of data
dimensions."
.. true, how is this approach better, if the layer of reconciliation is opaque.


who has stewardship of the resource; how will iterations of the resource be referenced and will previous iterations be accessible?

p4 and further; not sure if the way taxonomy is used is correct. "Here, we show how the NPO can be used to express taxonomies proposed by different research groups using modern techniques, enable comparisons between them, and enable queries with commonly used neuron types from the literature"


p5 fig1B ... I do not see how this figure is helpful or relevant

p8 fig3 ... where can the full set of predicates actually be found and reviewed? NPOKB is registered with bioportal (https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/NPOKB) but there not even all the predicates can be found that are referenced in this figure e.g. hasEpigeneticPhenotype

p9 ... "In this way, as proposed originally by Hamilton et al., (2012), it is easy to generate a human readable list of neurons from a given species or brain region and to compare across complex phenotypes." ... I think this is a good and valid approach.


Notes 01.02.2021

The process how data has to treated to be subjected to a search usind the reported owl restrictiobs is either missing or lacking a prominent description. Further the raw and transformed data used as basis for the competence queries is missing or obscurely described an placed.

Putting the core of the paper, the owl npo.ttl file in a side branch of a github repository is prone to removal. Get a doi for this essential data and put a version number on the file to keep it properly findable, accessible and reusable.

General Topic of the paper:
The authors describe the development of an ontology that aims at resolving neuronal cell type classifications across approaches and resources.
As a proof of concept the authors show the combination of phenotype information from three resources that use very different approches. To this end, the Web Ontology Language (OWL), has been employed to define a searchable set of "Neuron types" and combine it with already existing Ontology resources to create a searchable but easily expandable data source. Using, "competency queries" the authors also show that the database can then be actually used to extract specific phenotypic information and thus identifying similar neurons described in different resources.

Major issues:
	* The process of data import is completely opague. For someone to actually use the NPO this is not helpful and actually contradicts the FAIR principles. For example on  page 8: 2nd sentence the authors state that only those  "... protein, peptides and small molecules, that are thought to define the class" enter the database. This is an important decision. Who decides this? This may evolve over time. Such decisions made by the authors should be more clearly stated and justified.
	* The dataset is a secondary reference; how can the original data be accessed, verified and referenced? Easy backchecking should be part of the definition in this case to verify any result of a search.
	* NPO is publicly available but who has stewardship over the database? 
	* The authors explicitely state that the current paper is a proof-of-concept but they should at least hint at and discuss with other parts of neurosciences they are not covering, or how they should be integrated.
	* The distinction between Common Usage Types and Evidence Based Types is central to the paper but it should be introduced by actually describing figure 1 A 
	* The general approach of modelling a cell type as a "bag of phenotypes" is valid. Fig 2 illustrates the concept, but the link to the actual NPO terms is not described. "Species" or "Brain region" are general terms that can be used to categorize Neuron Pheontypes, but  they are not actual NPO terms as the figure caption suggests. Further the relation between Figure 2 and Table 1 is unclear; not all terms in Figure 2 map directly to Table 1 and a further description is not provided in the text.
	* figure 3 shows the predicates used in NPO, are they original NPO inventions or are they reused from other ontologies? How did you decide which predicates need to be defined and which could be reused from other ontologies? Further these terms cannot be found in the reference npo.ttl file; how are these terms actually tied into the NPO definition.
	* 


Minor issues:
	* Several info from supplement to main text, e.g. the information about the NIF Ontology 
	* https://github.com/SciCrunch/NIF-Ontology/blob/neurons/ttl/npo.ttl
	* page 6, 2nd paragraph: the term "disjointness axioms" falls out of the sky but may not be familiar to people not acquainted with OWL semantics.
	* page 6, bottom; Is there a reference for NeuronLang?
	* figure 3: predicate "hasExpressionPhenotypeDeterminedByEphysAndPharmacology": two comments: (1) is it wise to combine Ephys and Pharmacology in the same predicate? (2) inconsistency in using "ephys" abbreviated and spelled out in other predicates. 
	* Figure 4 caption: "Neuron Lang" and "Neuro DM" are sometimes referenced as "Neuro Lang" and "Neuron DM".

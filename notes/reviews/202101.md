RDF NeuroPheno classifications

Notes 20210123

- Very ephys centered ... crossover to imaging techniques, staining?
- p8 Fig3 ... the definitions for the predicates?

- p5 Fig1 ... what is the knowledge gain of the B) images? if there is none, please remove it

- p6 ... is the NPO onl for modeling as p6 exists? provide a definition of what this paper understands as modeling

- is this the full set of terms? if not how will it be expanded? e.g. does hasProteinExpression include stainings?

- p8 Fig3 ... is this the full model of molecular phenotypes

- Data and code availability is very hard to read

- p12 ... not yet transparent how the minimal list of set of molex/morph is chosen to define a neuron

is the aim of NPO aimed only at mammalian neurons? if not include other data and examples as well to show the approach works there too and how.

what do they ant to show/achieve with this paper?
... search of terms and comparison across databases and identifying techniques provided competent personal feeds the database.

what are the results supposed to show? that the defined classes enable search? where is the gold standard showing it finds what is supposed to be found based on the used data?

this approach depends on proper curation of data to classes
... where is the description of this process if people are supposed to use it on their own?

p15 ... what is the point of the result? cool, a search result can be interpreted but how does this lead back to the introduced POV(?)? strange assumption unless I miss something.

ok ... so is this whole approach there to compare across phenotypes? is there no other approach that has tried this? if yes where and why is the new one better; if no, where is this statement?

Neuron Phenotype Ont ... describing complex phenotypes of Neurons

p20 F3 ... "include ID of data it describes" ... is that true with respect to the DATA

p19 ... is the definition of CUT and EBT the same as above??

is this reproducible? where is the description how this ontology was created from the basic sources.

this paper leaves me very confused after the first read...


Notes 20210129

- in general the curation of the basis of this data set is not well described enough from my point of view.
- the dataset is a secondary reference; how can the original data be accessed, verified and referenced? mistakes happen, which is ok, but there needs to be a mechanism to easily backcheck whats in the data set, how it got there and from where.

    The approach is great, but it is a secondary source; when various people of various backgrounds try to adopt it and add to it mistakes are bound to happen. Easy backchecking should be part of the definition in this case to verify any result of a search.

p4 "Anyone who has attempted to read through multiple articles, each with their
own proposal for classifying cell types within a region understands the difficulties in trying to
reconcile the different schemes, even when they are based on limited numbers of data
dimensions."
.. true, how is this approach better, if the layer of reconciliation is opaque.


who has stewardship of the resource; how will iterations of the resource be referenced and will previous iterations be accessible?

p4 and further; not sure if the way taxonomy is used is correct. "Here, we show how the NPO can be used to express taxonomies proposed by different research groups using modern techniques, enable comparisons between them, and enable queries with commonly used neuron types from the literature"


p5 fig1B ... I do not see how this figure is helpful or relevant

p8 fig3 ... where can the full set of predicates actually be found and reviewed? NPOKB is registered with bioportal (https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/NPOKB) but there not even all the predicates can be found that are referenced in this figure e.g. hasEpigeneticPhenotype

p9 ... "In this way, as proposed originally by Hamilton et al., (2012), it is easy to generate a human readable list of neurons from a given species or brain region and to compare across complex phenotypes." ... I think this is a good and valid approach.

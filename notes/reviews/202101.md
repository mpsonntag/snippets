RDF Neuro classifications

Notes 20210123

- Very ephys centered ... crossover to imaging techniques, staining?
- p8 Fig3 ... the definitions for the predicates?

- p5 Fig1 ... what is the knowledge gain of the B) images? if there is none, please remove it

- p6 ... is the NPO onl for modeling as p6 exists? provide a definition of what this paper understands as modeling

- is this the full set of terms? if not how will it be expanded? e.g. does hasProteinExpression include stainings?

- p8 Fig3 ... is this the full model of molecular phenotypes

- Data and code availability is very hard to read


Notes 20210124

- p12 ... not yet transparent how the minimal list of set of molex/morph is chosen to define a neuron

is the aim of NPO aimed only at mammalian neurons? if not include other data and examples as well to show the approach works there too and how.

what do they ant to show/achieve with this paper?
... search of terms and comparison across databases and identifying techniques provided competent personal feeds the database.

what are the results supposed to show? that the defined classes enable search? where is the gold standard showing it finds what is supposed to be found based on the used data?

this approach depends on proper curation of data to classes
... where is the description of this process if people are supposed to use it on their own?

p15 ... what is the point of the result? cool, a search result can be interpreted but how does this lead back to the introduced POV(?)? strange assumption unless I miss something.

ok ... so is this whole approach there to compare across phenotypes? is there no other approach that has tried this? if yes where and why is the new one better; if no, where is this statement?

Neuron Phenotype Ont ... describing complex phenotypes of Neurons

p20 F3 ... "include ID of data it describes" ... is that true with respect to the DATA

p19 ... is the definition of CUT and EBT the same as above??

is this reproducible? where is the description how this ontology was created from the basic sources.

this paper leaves me very confused after the first read...
